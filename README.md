**Lichess-apitool is a python2 script for querying lichess-api for certain things.**

Right now the script returns lichess-tv urls for users listed in a linicks.txt file, and a list of best rated players of the usernames in linicks.txt.

The original usecase for this script is to return this information via irc bot, but it was implemented as a command-line script so that it could possibly be used elsewhere too and with multiple different irc clients or irc bots.
